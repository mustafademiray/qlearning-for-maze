This code gets the adjacency list from input.txt, creates a R matrix for open rooms and walls, 
          creates a Q matrix for path information,
          gets starting, ending and iteration number from user,
          with that values, finds a path from Q matrix,
          draws a maze and its path.
          and creates a outR, outQ and outPath txt's to the desktop.
